## main.py

The main.py script is an age calculator utility that demonstrates how to
calculate a person's age from their date of birth. It includes a
`calculate_age()` function that takes a date of birth in MM/DD/YYYY format and
returns the age in years, handling edge cases such as future dates by returning
0. The script also contains a demonstration that calculates and displays the age
for a sample birth date (01/01/1970), providing both a greeting message and the
computed age result.
